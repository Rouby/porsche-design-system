# Model Signature

<TableOfContents></TableOfContents>

## When to use

- Signatures should be used for emotional introduction and communication of model series.
- Consider using model signatures only occasionally, for example, within the Link Tiles component for a specific model
  line.
- Use model signatures as a subtle, larger background watermark, paired with appropriate visualization of vehicle detail
  pages. Ensure that the width of the model signature is equal to or smaller than the vehicle image and that the overlap
  provides sufficient visibility of the model signatures of the letters.
- Or as a headline-like element on model series overview pages.

## Do not use

- Avoid including signatures for specific derivatives such as a Panamera 4 Sport Turismo Platinum Edition or a 911 Targa
  4S or in line with text. The model signature should have sufficient spacing from text.
- Avoid repeating the same model series signature within the interface. For example, do not display the 911 signatures
  twice or more in a viewport.
